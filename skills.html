                        structuring and presenting content on the web. Released in October 2014, it brought significant
                        advancements over its predecessor, HTML4, by introducing new elements, attributes, APIs, and
                        features that enhance modern web development.</p>

                        CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 3) is the latest major version of the CSS standard used to
                        style
                        and layout web pages. It builds upon CSS2.1, introducing a wide array of features and
                        capabilities
                        to make web design more dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing. CSS3 allows developers to

                        JavaScript is a versatile, high-level, interpreted programming language that enables interactive
                        and
                        dynamic behavior on websites. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and
                        CSS.
                        JavaScript allows developers to create interactive web applications, control multimedia, animate
                        images, and much more.

                        React.js (or simply React) is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user
                        interfaces (UI), primarily for single-page applications (SPAs). It was developed by Facebook and
                        has
                        since become one of the most widely used front-end technologies for building interactive and
                        dynamic
                        web applications.

                        Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It is most commonly used
                        with
                        React, but it can be used with any other JavaScript framework or library as well. Redux provides
                        a
                        central store for all the applicationâ€™s state, making it easier to manage and debug the state
                        across
                        your application.

                        It helps in handling state in large-scale applications and managing side effects (like
                        asynchronous
                        operations). Redux makes the flow of data in an application predictable, making the development
                        process more maintainable and efficient.
